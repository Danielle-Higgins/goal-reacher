This project is built using Node.js with the Express.js framework. It also uses Passport/Passport Local for user authentication, bcrypt for password hashing, along with express sessions and flash to flash error messages for incorrect logins. All of the users data along with their todos will be stored in a MongoDB database. First the user will need to sign up entering their username, email, password and confirm their password as well. Once they sign up, they will be automatically logged in where they will be redirected to the todos page. One that page, they will be able to create their own todo list filled with what they need to get done. The user will be able to create todos, check and uncheck them, and delete them as well. The user will also be able to logout where they will be taken back to the main page and can log in again if needed.

## If you want to try this project out with dummy accounts:
Email: terra@example.com, bob@example.com
<br>
Password: terra1234, bob12345

## Optimizations

If/when I improve this project, I would like to allow the user to delete their account if they choose, as well as change their password if they were to ever forget it.

## Lessons Learned

I learned how to create a user sign up/login system using Passport/Passport Local for authenticating users. I also learned about the MVC Architecture.
